This app was created in a couple days for the challenge portion of the Shopify Internship Application. I used React and plain JavaScript (as opposed to TypeScript) in the interest of time. TailwindCSS was chosen for ease of rapid prototyping.
 
 As a user, you:
* can search for movies by keyword
* see appropriate messaging if there isn't a valid response from the API
* can add up to 5 movies to your nomination list
* see a banner after adding a 5th movie
* can remove items from your nomination list
* can refresh the page and see your previously chosen nominations
